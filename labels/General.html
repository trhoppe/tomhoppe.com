                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>We did a 4.5 mile hike today at Pine Mountain in Cartersville. It was nice to get out with our friends and the dogs, and I also played with the new 40D. We never knew that this mountain existed and its a great spot to get some hiking in about 20 mins from the house. Elevation went from 800ft to about 2k over 2 miles. Whew! </p>
<p>I do dig the new camera. The picture quality isn't that much better then the 350d, but the whole package is greatly improved. The "feel" in my hand is a lot nicer, and the shutter on it rocks. It just sounds a lot more solid. I had to throttle back the drive setting, as leaving the shutter button pressed for a split second too long results in 3-4 more pictures because of the fast fps the camera is capable of. The 3" screen also rules. Reviewing shots is a good bit easier then the 1.5" screen I got used to on the 350D. I'm looking forward to getting out and shooting more with the new toy. </p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So I got Cathy some roses for V day. Since I got the new camera, and the purple roses were unusual I snapped a couple of pictures. Don't think I'm going with simple red roses anymore, as the flower shop had a ton of other choices. We'll see what combo I come up with next time :)</p>

		<div class="post-body">
            <div>
                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So I pulled the trigger on my upgrade. I've used the 350D for over 2 years now. I'm an "ok" amateur and never thought I would need an upgrade. I went the $$$ glass route, as suggested by many peers smarter then I, and it was well worth it. I got some great shots out of my 350D and 70-200L,24-105Ls. Recently, I've gotten the gear bug though, and with the used 40Ds coming down so much in price, I finally pulled the trigger.</p>

<P>Here are my impressions of 40D over the 350D for anyone else considering such a move</p>

<ul>
<li>The "feel" of the camera is much better, yet smaller then my 350D + grip combo. The 350 w/o the grip is too small for my hands, but the 40D fits just perfectly.</li>
<li>The grip, the buttons, the locations, are just "right on" with this body, compared to being cramped in the 350D. I've seen people post that the 350D was a toy compared to the XXD series, and I kinda see what they are saying now.</li>
<li>The "click" of shutter sounds better. The 350D has more of a slap, where the motorized up and down of the 40D sounds a lot beefier.Its wierd, but I really like the sound of the 40D shutter. </li>
<li>In good light with 100 ISO, I can't really tell a difference between two "internet sized" shots. At full zoom, you can see a slight detail difference, but there isn't a huge wow factor in this situation</li>
<li>In low light, the difference really kicks in. 1600ISO on the 40D is about equal to 400ISO on the 350D. Its THAT much of a difference. I took a well exposed shot at 1600ISO and it looks excellent. Wow!</li>
<li>6.5fps = Wow. That part is NOT going to suck for taking 1/80th pans of race cars. The keeper ratio was low with the 350D when trying for such low shutter speeds. With the 6.5fps, I'll be able to nail a 4-5 shot combo of each car, where with the 350D i could get ~2 shots of "in frame" in.</li>
<li>Haven't noticed a huge difference in AF yet, but I haven't done any AI Servo work with race cars yet. The 40D seems to catch a little faster then I was used to, but its not that much. Then again, most of those were in great light, so the 350D didn't have much trouble and my amateur self never found the AF lacking with my 350D as I use the center point 99% of the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not saying the 350D is bad. Its certainly a GREAT body, and at current prices ($350 used) its a KILLER deal for someone trying to get into DSLRs. Its just that the 40D really is a great step up and with the improved controls/format/performance allows you to enjoy photography more. I'm sure liking mine, and glad I pulled the trigger finally..</p>

<p> We're going for a hike this afternoon, so I'll take it with me and take some test shot.

		<div class="post-body">
            <div>
                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So my race car is in the shop. Since I'm the DIY type, it doesn't happen that often, but after the ARRC wreck, I decided to have the car checked out by Trever, who is the one that built it. I looked it over at the house and it doesn't actually look too bad. The only thing out alignment wise was the right front camber and toe. Looks like the upright got bent. The other 3 wheels where right in sync with each other and not even more a smidgen. The bottom subframe, which was 1/16" away from the header looks to have maybe moved in the accident, hit the header slightly cracking it, and then moved back. Since thats a $$$ custom header, figured, lets have it fixed by folks that know more then I do.</p>
<p>Once Trever gives the car a thumbs up, I'll be taking it over to the body shop to have the rear quarter panel dents touched up and sprayed over with red paint. I might take it home inbetween and see how much of the body work I can touch up to save money. We'll see. Since I need new fenders and a new front bumper cover, I decided to go with a slightly different paint scheme for next season. I'm going to cover the hood and fenders with carbon fiber look vinyl, so I don't have to paint. And then extend that vinyl into the doors with some kind of design. The front bumper will stay "factory black" as its just easier that way.</p>
<p>Also yesterday was about the nicest day in the last month or so here, so we went out to the dog park with a couple of our friends and out for some beers and pizza. They had $5 PBR pitchers which I couldn't pass up :) I was actually pleasantly surprised at the taste of PBR being sober, as I usually reserve PBR for the end of the night once I don't care about what I'm drinking.</p>

This is an amazing temple and a serious work of art. The entire structure is floor to ceiling marble and the carvings and detail work is incredible. This particular one in Atlanta is the largest such temple outside of India and is a place we're going to have to take our Atlanta visitors from now on. We also did a little "mini tour" and learned a bit about the Hinduism. I wish I could have gotten some pictures of the interior but there are no cameras allowed inside. I took a panorama of the structure from the outside and a shot of the fountains out front.</p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So we've got most of house completed. Took a couple of weekends working our butts off, but it was totally worth it. The appraisal came back right at the amount we needed, and the house looks awesome inside now. We decided to put the outside on hold until the spring, and at that time redo the shutters and tear ALL the bushes out to create a clean new look. As far as the inside, we finished everything except the crown molding in the upstairs hallway. We didn't need to do it for the appraisal and I haven't been inspired enough to take care of recently :) The bathroom came out being our favorite "after" room, as Cathy's paint work on the cabinets transformed them from old school oak to a nice looking cherry finish. </p>
<p>Here are a couple of pictures of the WIP and the "before" on the bathroom. Once we put our paintings/etc on the walls and finish cleaning up I'll take some after pictures. </p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>We started out our vacation by flying into Denver and heading up to Fort Collins. Our friend Chuck lives there, and we picked him up on our way to steamboat. While we were in Fort Collins we took advantage of the <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/">New Belgium brewery</a> tour. New Belgium makes Cathy's favorite beer, skinny dip, as well as one of my faves, Fat Tire. With it being winter, they had a few awesome seasonals on tap, and it was the perfect start to our vacation. After a round of beers, it was time to head up to Steamboat.</p>
<p>Since we left Fort Collins late, we knew we would get a little of the snowstorm that was coming in, but we didn't quite expect it to be as bad as it was. We were driving 20mph and using our GPS to tell us where to road was headed as we couldn't see a damn thing out of the windshield. It was a helluva drive, but we made it no problem.</p>
<p>The skiing yesterday was sort of tough, as the 12 inches of snow didn't get groomed in time. The blues turned more difficult as ruts developed. It also snowed all day, and the fog made visibility a little short. It was still an incredibly fun time and we got our ski legs under us, as we haven't been out since Breckenridge last year.</p>
<p>Today was a totally different day, as the sun shone through, and the 13 degrees felt more like 50. The slopes were just awesome and we took quite a few runs down. Cathy turned in a bit early as her back was hurting, but the rest of us finished off the day on the slopes. We took quite a few runs on Tomahawk and the surrounding blues, did some jumps, and finished off the day with "3 oclock run" which was about the longest black diamond ever. Here is a pic from 3 oclock with the iPhone. I'll take the real camera tomorrow and have some awesome pics.</p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So I can't believe its been pretty much a whole month since I posted anything. Even though it was supposed to be a super easy one, the last few weeks have been pretty busy and crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ARRC</strong><br/>So November started out with the American Road Race of Champions. I have a car that is absolutely capable of winning this IT National Championship, but it wasn't to be. While I had a great qualifying run, I got punted on the 3rd turn of the 1st lap, which ended my race in a rough way. I ended up getting pinballed around by a few cars, and ended up out of the race, every panel on the car bent, and some busted suspension pieces. I was and am pretty miffed about the incident, so I took some time off from the car and decided to worry about other things for a while. I'll get back to the race car early next year. About $2k worth of damage or so, so not the end of the world. I had really shitty video, again, which prompted me to ask for a new bullet cam for Xmas. Next year, I'll have plenty of video action.</p>
<p><strong>Kitchen</strong><br/>So we finally finished painting the damn kitchen :) The color ended up great, and Cathy's mom visited and helped with painting the trim. All we gotta do now is clean it up and take some pictures. Coming Soon!</p>
<p><strong>New Hobby - HTPC</strong><br/>For thanksgiving, we went to visit Cathy's brother and family, and I saw their showtime streaming box for streaming PC content to their HDTV. Oh I was hooked. After considering a few options, I realized I had my old pre-upgrade PC still sitting in our office. I purchased a case at Microcenter, and a few hours later, had a new HTPC (Home Theater PC). 720p Blue Ray movies, TV shows from Europe, playing h.264 converted backups of my DVDs. I love it. Also for my birthday, I bought myself a new receiver, so now everything in the entertainment center is using HDMI. This thing is awesome. After watching Casino Royale in 720p with DTS sound, I think it started to grow on Cathy as well :)</p>
<p>Work has also been nuts. We've been working on some end of the year projects and its been 150mph since the beginning of October. All exciting work, but I've been working so much, I've been forgetting to post some of the cool stuff I've been doing. Once the new year hits, I'll have to write some of the cool JS things I've done on here.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we're heading to Colorado for the next week. Going to do some skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling in Steamboat Springs. Its been snowing pretty good the last few weeks out west (we have 28" of base) so the skiing should be good. We'll have plenty of pics of the trip and shenanigans when we get back. Its also going to be VERY weird not working for 2 weeks (going to Raleigh right after), but somehow I think I can manage :) </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/All.html">All</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/General.html">General</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/Racing.html">Racing</a></p>

            <div>
                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So I went to Brandsmart tonight and pulled the trigger on an LG 47" LCD HDTV. When compared to the Sharp Aquos 52" we were thinking about, it just had better "pop" on the blacks, no matter what the settings. Also figured that sitting 8-10' from the TV, the 47" would actually look better.</p>

<p>Took this thing home and plopped it right next to the 3 year old LCD Projection 50" Hitachi that I currently have. I was thinking that I'd get a big upgrade in black levels, sharpness, picture quality etc etc by going to a "new" LCD TV versus the LCD projection that I've had for a while now.</p>

<p>After hooking both of them up to the cable box and tinkering with some settings on both TV's (got the LG looking great with the recommended CNET settings and then set up the Hitachi to look like the LG), we realized that its the same damn picture. While there is a slight difference in the black levels, its definitely only slight and can be noticed when viewing dark scenes. Watching normal TV, or discovery HD as we were, its hardly damn noticable. Maybe with a Blu-Ray player we could see it, but on normal HDTV and then upscaled regular DVD, there is just no way to justify the purchase.</p>

<p>I guess in the end I saved myself some $$ as it looks like we're just going to keep this 50" Hitachi till it goes away, or until OLED's come down in price, cause it ain't worth it going to a 1080P LG LCD right now. Color me surprised. </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/All.html">All</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/General.html">General</a></p>

            <div>
                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>One of the reasons we went up to Raleigh was to hit up Franklin street for Halloween night. Having it on Friday should have meant a great turnout. Unfortunately, Chapel Hill got tired of being invaded by 80k people for that one night, so they put in a bunch of measures to bring the number of people way down. They basically discouraged any out of towners from showing up, by blocking parking everywhere and all side roads/neighborhoods. We met up with Cathy's friend Lee and her roomate and went anyways.</p><p>I dressed up as a NJ guido, complete with the spiked hair, headband, sweet glasses and double polos with popped collars. Cathy went as facebook. She ended up with a "fail" rating for the execution of the book on the head, as we forgot to measure for the fact that the headband she bought would expand once we put it on her head. Her shirt was great though, and we were able to write her status on her through the night. Lee was a drama queen, and her roommate went as Bristol Palin.</p><p>While there was still a decent turnout, it was nowhere as many people as in previous years. Also, the quality of costumes seemed to be down a bit. We did see some funny ones, and even though I got a littly drinky ;) I took some pictures. I'll post them up here shortly.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/All.html">All</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/General.html">General</a></p>

We sort of took last weekend off when we went camping, and went to the Apple festival and drank a bunch of beer yesterday. Other then that, I've been good and been following the diet. Its actually pretty easy to follow and I like it. I like the lunches a lot better then the usual microwave frozen lunch, and its actually more economical as I don't spend $8 a day on lunch every day. I'm a fan. I've lost 5 lbs so far. If I lose another 5 over the next two weeks, I'll be happy. </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/All.html">All</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/General.html">General</a></p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So after about 3 weeks of being down, and probably 12-14 hours of total work, the  lift is on. I worked on it about 2 hours a day, every 3rd day, lol. I guess thats the nice thing about having plenty of other cars to drive. I took the car to 4wheelparts after the install to get the caster and pinion angles set during the alignment. Figured the $100 was well spent, as never having even seen a stock Jeep, I didn't know exactly what the pinion angle should be. They ended up finding that the front trackbar bushing was busted, something I missed during the install, so the $$ was well spent. Another $200 later, we had a pimpy adjustable front trackbar with spherical ends. </p>
<p>We took the Jeep out yesterday for its maiden voyage, up to the Apple festival in Ellijay. While the festival was fun, our search for some 4 wheeling in that area was a big fat FAIL. We ended up playing in some construction sites and gravel roads and found out the lift was a success. The Jeep is a beast now. Once we add the front locker to it shortly, it will be pretty much unstoppable. </p><p>Here are a few pictures in "highway" mode with the top up.</p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So my parents just "got" me the NutriSystem package after calling me fat for the last year or two. Guess I'll turn this into Project Fatass and see what I can do. I weighed in this morning at 224.0 and started the diet. I also have my plan to get back to "fighting shape". I've been playing soccer and tennis and just realizing that I'm way out of shape compared to where I've been in the past. Few years of sitting at a desk and playing with cars I guess :) </p>
<p>The nutrisystem is pretty cool so far. Good amount of food, but spread throughout the day, so you are not hungry. I think the main goal is showing you how much to each, and by liming the amount, making sure you don't overeat. Also, splitting up your food categories, so you get enough of everything. One of the first things I've noticed, is I don't eat much dairy and veggies at all. This plan has me do 3-4 servings of dairy/protein a day. </p>
<p>I'm also going to take the next season off of soccer and tennis and hit the gym and mountain bike to get some strength and endurance. I'll be back with a vengeance for the spring season :)</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/All.html">All</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/General.html">General</a></p>

They are a mix of hip hop with horns and have a great sound. They played at the Pour House in downtown Raleigh which is always a good time. I brought the camera, but ended up doing more drinking then picture taking and it showed :) <a href="http://www.theurbansophisticates.com">Check out their website</a> as they have their music streaming on it.

		<div class="post-body">
            <div>
                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>Since I've had the MacBook Pro I've been wanting it to "hibernate" instead of "sleep" when I close the lid. There are times when I've shut the lid, stuck it into my backpack, just to not look at it again for 3 days over a long weekend. During that time, even in regular sleep mode, the battery dies as the laptop is not all the way off. My Thinkpad on the other hand can fully hibernate, in which it turns itself all the way off and stores its current state to the hdd.</p>
<p>Turns out that the MacBooks have the same mode, but its not an option in the menu. After a little digging, <a target="_blank" href="http://gabrito.com/post/hibernate-with-the-macbook-pro">I've found a site that tells you what to do.</a> I've outlined the steps below for "mac noobs" such as myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Finder, Utilities, Terminal</li>
<li>type <span style="font-style:italic;">pmset -g | grep hibernate</span></li>
<li>You should see that your hibernate is set for mode 3. This means when it sleeps, your items are saved to the RAM and power stays on. What you want is to set that to mode 5 which will function just like windows hibernate, and actually turn your laptop all the way off while saving where your state to the hdd. </li>
<li>Create two aliases, one to enable mode 5, and another to set back to 3 if you want.</li>
<li>Type <span style="font-style:italic;">alias hibernateon="sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 5"</span></li>
<li>Type <span style="font-style:italic;">alias hibernateoff="sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3"</span></li>
<li>Now when you type <span style="font-style:italic;">hibernateon</span>, it will set that mode to 5. Once you do that, type <span style="font-style:italic;">pmset -g | grep hibernate</span> again to confirm that you are on mode 5</li>
<li>Your laptop is now set to hibernate like windows when you close the lid. If you ever want to revert back, run terminal again and type <span style="font-style:italic;">hibernateoff</span></li>

		<div class="post-body">
            <div>
                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>This is easy as pie. With the below steps, you can take any MP3 and make it into a ringtone for your iPhone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab the MP3 you want to turn into a ringtone and using <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/">Audacity</a> turn it into an MP3 that is <strong>less then 30 seconds in length.</strong></li>
<li>Drag the newly shortened file into iTunes</li>
<li>Find it in iTunes, right click on it and choose "Convert to AAC". It will make another version of the song.</li>
<li>Find that song in your iTunes folder library (probably c:/..../My Documents/My Music/iTunes) and rename if from .m4a to m4r. In iTunes, delete the m4a that you made. </li>

We picked the final paint color tonight and I'll be picking some up tomorrow to get the wall paint finished. After that, the trim/doors are going white and the crown molding gets installed. Finally the stair banister pieces are getting traded out for nice metal ones and we'll be able to call our downstairs "finished" :)</p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>After the Barber race on Memorial Day weekend, we decided to go hiking on the Amicalola Falls trails around Ellljay, GA. The hiking was pretty good, but like last time, the views weren't quite there. There were more trees then you know what to do with, but no clearings or balds to see any views. We got to stop by the falls and walk the 600 steps to the top. Good exercise :)</p><p>This area is the start of the Appalachian trail on the south end. I still want to take a long weekend and go hike some of the trail. We'll see when we get to it</p>

I discovered yesterday that I have a coolant leak somewhere. Looks to be around the middleish of the motor so maybe its a cracked hose or similar. Going to diagnose this weekend and get her ready for the Barber race at the end of August.</p>
<p>Ok, back to the kitchen. We got the granite installed today. Looks absolutely AWESOME. We also decided to punt on the track lighting. Having 6 halogen bulbs gets HOT and there isn't quite as much light as we wanted. We are going with 4 5" recessed canned lights instead. 300W of brightness :)</p>
<p>The wall and new lights are getting installed tomorrow, so we should have a "done kitchen" by tomorrow night.</p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So despite a few minor setbacks, Robert (the contractor) has been kicking ass on the kitchen. We started the install with him cutting a hole in his arm on our microwave mount when he "discovered" a hot wire just hanging inside the wall. The PITA continued as the wiring to remove the soffett was a lot harder then originally planned. They actually have to undo some of the wires from the fuse panel and re-run it in order to make it fit. It ended looking great though!</p>
<p>Yesterday the cabinets started going in and are now fully installed. The only thing left is to shim the one next to the fridge and the wine rack above it. We also had the trash compactor installed, the new boxes put in for our track and pendant lighting, and the wall for our backsplash/bar built. </p>
<p>Tomorrow morning the granite installers come to template out and Robert is going to finish off the wall as well as install our fancy shock "auto close" drawers. Over the weekend I think we're going to start to paint and also install all the lighting now that the boxes are ready. I'm thinking I might also tackle the under cabinet lighting now that all the wires are run already :)</p>

<p>I took a few shots along the way to show the progress.</p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>Today started the install of the new kitchen. We picked out some awesome "mocha" colored cabinets from a local shop in Macon. They have everything from solid wood sides, to the soft close drawers. We also got the 42" tall cabinets and are removing that soffet from above the current cabinets. The tall cabinets should make the kitchen look a lot taller. Also getting some "baltic brown" granite installed, under cabinet lighting, and ceiling track lighting with some pendant dropdowns. Should be pretty "pimpy". Here are a couple of pictures of the work in progress so far. It looks really weird having a "blank room" instead of a kitchen :) Tomorrow the new cabinets go in, Wednesday the lighting, and then Saturday the granite gets installed.</p>

Corporate email support, 3G, GPS, and now I've got one :)</p><p>It was quite an adventure this morning, as I got in line around 6:30am at the store a few mins from our house. I was 55th in line (lucky number, sweet) and there were people that spent the night waiting.</p><p>The whole process with AT&T was a total and gigantic clusterfuck. Their systems were up, their systems were down, their systems were slow. They did something last night so where the staff had no idea what they were doing and were reading off instructions off printed sheets. Half the people that showed up to buy a phone had no idea of contracts, some didn't have their license on them, just plain WOW</p><p>At least I had my laptop and wireless, so I got a bunch of work done while I waited. I got the phone and busted out of there after the lady told me everything was perfectly setup. 3 hours later and I've still got No Service. Time to call AT&T. Coming from Verizon, I'm real happy to have the iPhone, but real skeptical on being an AT&T customer. I hope this experience so far isn't repeated on down the road :)</p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>Yesterday ended up being the last day we had Rascal as a foster. I was figuring it was about time he got adopted out, and I did just buy a new lens for my camera, so it was time to take some pictures.</p><p>The new lens is simply awesome. Its the 24-105L and its miles beyond the 17-85 that I had before. Instant focus and great contrast and colors. I had to adjust the photoshop workflow a bit as I no longer need to do anything to the pictures before posting :) </p>
<p>On the dog note, Rascal did get adopted out today, which made us a bit sad. He was an awesome dog and if not for the fact that I won't allow 3 dogs in the house, Cathy wanted to keep him. We got a new hound/lab/something mix, Jess, for the next few weeks, so we'll see how Zoey adjusts to having a new friend around</p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>Over memorial day weekend we went to do some camping in the NC mountains. We tried a new spot, Fire Creek, next to Hayesville. While the hiking was great, the views kind of sucked. Hence no pretty overlook pictures. This was the first time out camping/hiking with Zoey and she had an absolute blast. She was a great dog off the leash and she had a blast playing in the streams.</p>
<p>The 4Runner also proved itself off road. We picked a far away camping spot, about 6 miles down a hole ridden gravel/rock road. Got the point the GPS had no idea where we were anymore :)</p>
<p>The pictures aren't the greatest quality, but it was a great time!</p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>I've used craigslist off and on to sell and buy random stuff. I've sold both our recent cars on it, and also bought the Jeep using it. We've also recently started cleaning out junk out of the house. I'm loving the fact that we can get $25 for an old desk that I hate. Finally got rid of the old fridge in the garage, and we're upgrading Cathy's end tables/coffee table in the fireplace room. </p>

<p>We also spent a decent amount of time on the house this weekend. Finished painting the ceilings downstairs, and Cathy spent a bunch of time sanding/caulking the fireplace room to get it, and the trim ready for paint. </p>

<p>Also had the install contractor come out and confirm everything for the new kitchen. New cabinets and the granite is getting ordered today. Should be here in a few weeks. Kitchen is going to look pimp. Its pretty funny how your perspectives change over time. 2 years ago, I wouldn't have given a crap about a new kitchen, while now, its actually going to be kind of cool having a pimpy looking kitchen.</p>

<p>I also tore down the front of the race car. The drivers side axle was way busted, but nothing else was damaged or worn. Since I have some spare axles, I'm going to repack them with Redline grease and raise the car 0.5" before I do anything else about axles. I forgot that last time I swapped the springs, I must not have adjusted the ride height all the way correct, and the car was too low. That screws up the suspension geometry and eats axles. Oh well, lesson learned...</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/All.html">All</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/General.html">General</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/Racing.html">Racing</a></p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So its been a busy back half of April for us. We've continued on the house repaint by starting on the dining room and front hallway. We also finally found a SWEET Jeep for Cathy. 1998 Wrangler in great shape. It has an ARB bumper, Warn winch, new 33" tires, and a 20k mile motor/transmission. We already threw on some wheel spacers for a wider/better stance, and the suspension lift gets here next week. The below pic is "pre spacers". Looks much better now. </p>

<p>I also broke my hand at soccer. Blocked a shot, dove after the rebound and got kicked right in the left pinky. 6 weeks in a splint, so the racing is once again put on hold. At least I'll save some money! The car should have the new HDTV in-car cam for the next event, as well as the new splitter. Should be even faster then last time and have awesome video to boot. The next even is May 31st at Road Atlanta.</p>

<p>Pic of the Jeep and a recent one of Zoey. I'll take some shots of the Jeep "post spacers" this weekend, and finally get some of the painted walls to go with our "before" shots.</p>

            <div>
                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So we bid farewell to the Mini today. Sold it through craigslist and a guy from Fl few up to drive it back home today. Guess that makes 17 cars in 12 years, soon to be 19. Not bad!</p>
<p>All in all, it was a nice car, but ironically a little too "Mini" for Cat. The inside of the car is generous and has plenty of room, but the car just "ends" outside of the windows. Its a different experience then being in a normal car, as everyone is RIGHT NEXT TO YOU on the highway.</p>
<p>I actually liked the car, and if it was a 5 speed, it probably would have replaced the Mazda3 for daily beater duties. It was fun as hell through the turns and got 30mpg for my commute. </p>
<p>Right now, the top of the list for the 4Runner replacement is a 2002-03 Acura TL. They are basically a Japanese, FWD, BMW 330i. Exactly what Cat wants. Then as soon as the 4Runner sells, its going to be time for a Jeep. I'm excited about that one :)</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/All.html">All</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/General.html">General</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/Racing.html">Racing</a></p>

<p>In my current day job of product development and client-side engineering, I haven't been messing much with ASP, other then the occasional support for some in-house apps</p>
<p>I recently took a side job to make a database driven website for a jewelry store. The front end was a piece of cake, and took less time then I estimated. The asp back-end/adming tool/shopping cart on the other hand, bleh. Having been working pretty much 100% with Javascript, I "lost" the ASP syntax, methods, etc. I had to look all that up on google. I knew "what" I wanted to do, but I just couldn't write it off the cuff like I can with JS these days. </p>
<p>In the end, it took certainly longer then planned, but I'm glad that I did it. I got the "asp mindset" back, and I haven't lost a step in my day job either. Guess I came out smarter overall :)</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/All.html">All</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/CSS.html">CSS</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/General.html">General</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/Javascript.html">Javascript</a></p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So we got a Mini Cooper! Cathy wanted to cut out the almost $600/month payment on the 4Runner and something with better gas mileage. This guy was meant to be an ITB race car, but after looking at the costs, we decided to postpone that build, and have Cat daily drive it</p>
<p>So far its pretty cool. We took it in to get detailed as the interior was kinda messy. Going to get the plate for it tomorrow and Cat can start driving Friday. </p>

                <div style="clear:both;"></div><p>So along with all the race car fun, we've also started to really work on the house. When we moved in over 6 months ago, we knew the house was in need of repainting on the inside, but we just didn't realize how much of a pain that is.</p>

<p>So far, we've completed the master bedroom and the trim in the upstairs hallway, as well as the 2nd spare bedroom. Painting turns into a real hassle when you not only have to do 2 coats on the walls, but 3 coats (including primer) on the oak stained trim, and also paint the ceiling.</p>

<p>We got motivated the other day and realized that if we do the living room, and lose the TV for a while in doing so, we'll get a lot more done on the house. Otherwise, its just too easy to get lost in front of the 50" big screen. </p>

<p>I'll have some in progress pics of the living room tonight. We ran the speaker and subwoofer wire from a box behind the TV, under the crawlspace, and into the rear walls. Looks very pro. I'm looking forward to hooking the surround up and watching a movie!</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/All.html">All</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/General.html">General</a></p>

<p>Primarily, I'm going to use this to keep track of my racing addiction, but I also want to use this to retain some of the neat code snippets and other info that I learn over time.</p>

<p>Most recently, I started playing around and discovering jQuery. What a sweet library. Its fairly compact, and as they imply, it makes DOM manipulation very easy. I wrote a few scripts of my own for JS motion and fading, but I realized that I'm trying to reinvent the wheel here and decided to use jQuery's instead.</p>

<p>I also happened upon <a href="http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/" target="_blank">thickbox</a> (Thanks Corey!) and really liked it. It does basically what lightbox does, but less code and less "crap". There are a few features of lightbox that I liked, so I wrote my own versions of them on top of thickbox. I'm going to use my version of it on here to revamp my very poorly setup photo gallery, and also through my blog for images.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/All.html">All</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.tomhoppe.com/labels/General.html">General</a></p>
